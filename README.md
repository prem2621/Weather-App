## 💡 Developer Reflection

✍️ "This is actually my very first project built in React. At the time, I added a lot of unnecessary npm modules and didn't know about best practices like using .env for API keys properly.

But I'm not ashamed of those mistakes — in fact, I'm proud. Because when I look back now, I realize how far I’ve come.

Mistakes taught me more than success ever could. They were my teachers. Today, I know what not to do — and that itself makes me stronger.

If you’re a beginner reading this — remember: you don’t have to start perfect. Just start. Stay consistent, and every step will lead you closer to greatness."

### 🌱 “From messy folders to modular components, this journey is my growth – and it’s just the beginning.”
